# Smart Home IoT System

A complete smart home automation system built and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This project demonstrates the integration of **IoT devices, edge computing, automation scripts, and security protocols** to create an intelligent and responsive home environment. 

## 🏠 Features

- 🔒 **Secure Entry System**   
  RFID-enabled doors with camera surveillance and motion sensors.
  
- 🚗 **Vehicle Detection and Entry**  
  IR sensor and smart gate system for automatic car recognition and entry.

- 💡 **Smart Lighting and Appliances**  
  Auto-controlled lights and fans based on presence and environment conditions.

- 🔔 **Alarm and Notification System**  
  Triggered on unauthorized access or critical conditions (fire, gas leak, etc.).

- 📷 **CCTV & Camera Logic**  
  Cameras that record automatically based on motion triggers.

- 🌐 **Remote Access Dashboard** *(Simulated)*  
  Control and monitor devices through a central system or mobile app concept.

- 🔌 **Energy Efficient Automation**  
  Scheduled and conditional device operations for optimized energy usage.
